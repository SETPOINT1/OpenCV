# OpenCV Ball Tracking with Live Graph

This project is a Python application that uses the OpenCV library to perform real-time object tracking in a video. It is designed to identify a specific colored object (like a ball), track its vertical position (Y-coordinate), and visualize this data as a live-updating graph using Matplotlib.

## Features

-   **Real-time Color-Based Object Tracking:** Identifies and tracks the largest object of a specified color in the video feed.
-   **Live Data Visualization:** Plots the vertical position (Y-coordinate) of the tracked object on a beautiful, real-time graph generated by Matplotlib.
-   **Debugging Mask:** Displays a separate "mask" window, showing exactly what the program "sees" in black and white. This is extremely useful for calibrating color detection.
-   **Performance Monitoring:** Calculates and displays the current Frames Per Second (FPS) on the main video window.
-   **Easy Configuration:** All major parameters (video file, color range, object size) can be easily adjusted in the configuration section at the top of the script.

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the project running on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the Repository
First, clone this repository to your computer.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SETPOINT1/OpenCV.git
cd OpenCV
```

### 2. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
It's a best practice to create a virtual environment to keep dependencies isolated.
```bash
# Create the environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate the environment (on Windows)
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
Install all the required Python libraries using the `requirements.txt` file.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Download the Video File
The video file is not included in this repository due to its size. You can download the required video from the Google Drive link below.

-   **[Download Video Files from Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-K7shK4DyYtl5SdsU6VE3cnZ40MlDyke?usp=sharing)**

After downloading, follow these steps:
1.  Inside the main `OpenCV` project directory, create a new folder named `video`.
2.  Place the downloaded video file (e.g., `10349005-uhd_4096_2160_25fps.mp4`) inside this newly created `video` folder.

The final structure should look like this:
```
OpenCV/
├── video/
│   └── 10349005-uhd_4096_2160_25fps.mp4
├── OpenCV.py
├── requirements.txt
└── README.md
```
